# Wiki-Web-Scraper
Developed a Selenium-based web scraper and parser to extract data from a Wikipedia page. Implemented an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to transform the extracted data into a JSON file. This JSON file serves as a potential data source for an API, enhancing data accessibility.
